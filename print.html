    <h3>Liability for content:</h3>
      <p>The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we cannot guarantee that the content is correct, complete
         or up-to-date. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws
          in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 TMG. However, according to Sections 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider we are not
           obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
            activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general law remain unaffected.
             However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. If we become
              aware of any corresponding legal violations, we will immediately remove this content.</p>
      <h3>Liability for links</h3>
      <p>Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. We therefore cannot assume
         any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content
          of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was
           not apparent at the time of linking. However, permanent control of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without
            concrete evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will immediately remove such links.</p>
      <h3>Copyrights</h3>
        <p>The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to US copyright law. Reproduction, processing,
           distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective
            author or creator. If the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected.
             In particular contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement,
              we ask that you notify us accordingly. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will immediately remove such content.</p>

        <br>
       <p> Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On
         behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile
          reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage to the website
